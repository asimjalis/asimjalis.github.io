What about fencing?

```python
printf("hello world\n");
printf("hello world\n");
printf("hello world\n");
```

```clojure
(println "hello world")
```

This is a test. 

Lets see what this looks like.

Here is some code.

    printf("hello world\n");
    printf("hello world\n");
    printf("hello world\n");
    printf("hello world\n");

Now back to text.

Can we change this?
