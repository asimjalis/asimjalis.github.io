## SSH Timeout
How can I prevent my SSH connection to EC2 from timing out?

- To prevent SSH from terminating after 60 seconds put this line in
    `~/.ssh/config`
    
    ``` 
    ServerAliveInterval 50
    ```

## Viewing EC2 Instance Logs
How can I see EC2 instance syslogs in CloudWatch?

- Set up a CloudWatch Logs agent on the EC2 instance
- This agent will push your logs into CloudWatch Logs
- Quick walkthrough steps: <https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/cloudwatch-log-service/> 
- Details: <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CWL_GettingStarted.html>

## DynamoDB Encryption
Can you encrypt data in DynamoDB?

- DynamoDB supports client-side encryption and does not support
  server-side encryption
- Details:
  <https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/client-side-encryption-for-amazon-dynamodb/> 

## S3 Key Salting
Why doesn’t S3 automatically salt the key names with hash prefixes instead of making customers do this?

- The keys are stored in contiguous partitions based on lexicographic
  order 
- Lexicographic order allows S3 to easily return all the files inside
  a folder (everything with the same prefix).

## Billing and Cost Management
How can I find out my billing reports?

- Trusted Advisor
    - Click on Services → Trusted Advisor
    - This will show you if you have any idle EC2 instances or RDS instances
    - It runs across all regions
- Billing & Cost Management
    - Click on: Your user name (top right corner) → Billing & Cost Management
    - Or go directly to: <https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/> 
    - This will show you your current bill and projected bill for next month
    - You can enable more detailed billing by storing data into S3

## Lambda Hello World
How can I write a simple hello world function using Lambda that is accessible from the web?

- Configure IAM permissions
- Use the code below for the function
- Configure API gateway to point to the function

``` python
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    print "Hello world from lambda"
    return {
        'statusCode' : 200,
        'headers' : { 
          'x-custom-header' : 'my custom header value' 
        },
        'body' : 'Hello, world!'
    }
``` 

## Minecraft on AWS
How can I set up Minecraft on AWS quickly using a CloudFormation template?

- This is an example Minecraft CloudFormation template
- <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zcrowell/paxdevdemo/master/CloudFormation/MineCraft_Server.json>

## Networking Internals
How do the internals of AWS networking work?

- A Day in the Life of a Billion Packets

## Referencing Security Groups Across VPCs
Can I use security groups across peered VPCs to allow groups of instances from one VPC to access particular ports in another VPC?

- You can reference security groups across VPCs
- Details: <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/PeeringGuide/working-with-vpc-peering.html#vpc-peering-security-groups> 
- Announcement from March 2016: <https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2016/03/announcing-support-for-security-group-references-in-a-peered-vpc/> 

## Public IPs and ifconfig 
Why does ifconfig -a not show the public IP address of an EC2 instance and only the private IP address?

- Public addresses are set on the IGW. 
- Excerpt from docs: "The Internet gateway logically provides the one-to-one NAT on behalf of your instance"  
- Details: <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Internet_Gateway.html> 

## Security Groups and VPCs
Can a security group span multiple VPCs?

- Security groups belong to a VPC so they cannot span multiple VPCs

## Static Private IPs
How can I make sure that my EC2 instance maintains the same private IP address even if it crashes? 

- Enable auto-recovery on your EC2 instance
- If the instance terminates this restart it with the same private IP address, same instance ID, and the same metadata

## Static Public IPs
How can I make sure my EC2 instance maintains the same public IP address?

- Use an Elastic IP address (EIP)

## Route 53 and DNSSEC
Does Route 53 support DNSSEC?

- Amazon Route 53 supports DNSSEC for domain registration but does not support DNSSEC for DNS service
- If you want to configure DNSSEC for a domain that is registered with Amazon Route 53, you must use another DNS service provider.
- <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/domain-configure-dnssec.html> 

## VMware Templates and AMIs
Can I convert a VMware template into an AMI?

- You can import VM images as AMIs
- Use the `vm-import` service to do this
- <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/vm-import/latest/userguide/vmimport-image-import.html>
- <https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/vm-import/>

## Restricting EC2 Permissions by VPC
Is it possible to use IAM permissions to allow users to spin up EC2 instances inside a Dev VPC while preventing them from spinning up EC2 instances inside the Prod VPC?

- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-supported-iam-actions-resources.html>
- Scroll down to "RunInstances"; it shows you what resources/keys you can use in the policy
- `arn:aws:ec2:region:account:subnet/*` is one of the resources you can restrict on

## RDS and HIPAA
What RDS databases can I use if I want to be HIPAA compliant and have a Business Associate Agreement with Amazon?

- You can use MySQL and Oracle (databases must use encryption): <https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/hipaa-compliance/>
- Details on how to write HIPAA compliant applications on AWS: <https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/compliance/AWS_HIPAA_Compliance_Whitepaper.pdf>
